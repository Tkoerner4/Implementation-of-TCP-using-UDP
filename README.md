# Implementation-of-TCP-using-UDP

This repository contains the implementation of the Mason Transport Protocol (MTP), a reliable transport protocol built over UDP. Unlike standard TCP, MTP ensures reliable file transfer between two machines by handling packet loss and corruption. The project includes a sender and receiver program, where the sender transmits a file over UDP, and the receiver verifies its integrity upon completion
